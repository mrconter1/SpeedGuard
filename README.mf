## SpeedGuard

### Overview

The "SpeedGuard" is an Android app designed to help passengers and drivers maintain safe driving speeds. The app checks the speed of the car and emits an annoying sound if the car is driven 10% over the speed limit. This is meant to encourage safe driving practices and ensure a more comfortable ride for passengers.

### Goal

The goal of this tool is to promote safer driving habits by alerting drivers when they exceed the speed limit by a certain margin. This can be particularly useful for passengers who prefer a safe and steady ride, as well as for drivers who want to improve their driving discipline.

### Features

### Connectivity

### Prompt Specification

This project is based on a detailed [Prompt Specification](PROMPT_SPEC.md) designed to guide its creation. The prompt provides high-level information that fully describes the application with the least amount of details necessary to ensure the final product meets the intended goals without writing the actual code. It covers aspects such as input constraints, real-time feedback, and additional details.
