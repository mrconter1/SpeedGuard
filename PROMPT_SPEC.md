## Prompt Specification

This prompt specification is designed to be all that is needed to write the code for the "SpeedGuard" project.

### Project Goal

Create an Android app that helps drivers and passengers maintain safe driving speeds by emitting an annoying sound when the car is driven 10% over the speed limit, with specific constraints and real-time feedback.

### Detailed Specifications

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Configurable speed limit settings for different types of roads.
   - The app should allow users to set these values within a reasonable range.
   - The sound should be emitted proportionally to the speed over the limit.

2. **Connectivity Options:**
   - **GPS:** The app should utilize the phone's GPS to monitor the car's speed and compare it to the set speed limit.

3. **Real-time Feedback:**
   - Display real-time feedback of the current speed on the app interface.
   - Provide visual indicators to help users understand their speed relative to the limit.
   - Include a real-time speed display on the app for user reference.

4. **User Interface:**
   - The app should have a modern and intuitive interface.
   - Use a visually appealing and modern font.
   - Ensure the interface is optimized for both smartphones and tablets.
   - Include a description at the top of the app explaining the purpose and functionality of the tool.
   - Provide easy-to-use controls for setting up and calibrating speed limit alerts.

5. **Design Requirements:**
   - The app should look professional and modern.
   - Ensure the design is user-friendly and accessible.
   - Optimize the app for dark mode.
   - Ensure compatibility with a wide range of Android devices.

6. **Additional Details:**
   - The interface should be intuitive and user-friendly.
   - Ensure the app provides a seamless and responsive experience.
   - Include a help section with instructions and troubleshooting tips.
